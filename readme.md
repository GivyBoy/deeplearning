Hello, world!

I am Anthony, a sophomore at the University of Miami, who has a keen interest in learning about Computer Vision 
applications of deep learning, among other things :) 

This repo will document my journey as I learn to apply deep learning to solve various problems. I will be focusing on
computer vision applications (**hint-hint** I'm starting w/ CNNs) , however I might write a few GAN models too. I want to see if I can use GANs to create
synthetic data for different applications (eg, medical sciences, finance, object detection, etc).

This repo will be used indefinitely, for at least a couple of years. If I have any major projects, I may create a
separate repo and link it here. Aside from that, if (for any reason) you need to contact me, you may do so at:
anthonygivans@miami.edu or anthonygivans876@gmail.com. **Let's get learning!**
