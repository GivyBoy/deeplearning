## Hello, world!

I am Anthony, a junior at the University of Miami, who has a keen interest in learning about Computer Vision applications of deep learning, among other things :)

This repo will document my journey as I learn to apply deep learning to solve various problems. I will be focusing on computer vision applications, specifically semantic segmentation.

This repo will be used indefinitely, for at least a couple of years. If I have any major projects, I may create a separate repo and link it here. Aside from that, if (for any reason) you need to contact me, you may do so at: anthonygivans@miami.edu or anthonygivans876@gmail.com. **Let's get learning!**
